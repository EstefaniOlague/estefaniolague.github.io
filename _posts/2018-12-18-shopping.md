__***Online Shopping***__

Online shopping is a great way to find clothes, shoes and accessories that you may not find in your local stores. As will as these stores having unique clothing items to great quality. Half the time these online shopping websites have things for less of the price, if not they have got sales going on and discounts even though it begin an online store. There are many online fashion shopping websites, some of the most common ones, known by me and others are Laura's boutique, Fashion Nova, lola shoetique and Ego. These 4 shopping websites include from buying shoes to clothing items and accessories. A great tip for some of these websites is to check and see if one of your favorite vlogger/youtubers/social media have discount codes most of them always do!

__***In Store Shopping***__

Shopping in stores can be overwhelming, especially if stores aren't organized, unless you are a person who loves to shop and has the time. Stores always tend to have there clothes organized by size, color, style, or brand. Always tend go to the section that is your size when going to a store that doesn't have its clothes well organized, such as Ross begin an example. Always have an idea on your outfit so you can go straight to that style and color to save time. I always thinking “whatever catches your attention/eye while looking around go straight to it, it caught your eye for a reason”. When you go shopping take a person who likes shopping to and gives good advice don't take someone who get annoyed really quick and gets stressed @ your boyfriend LOL! Forever 21, Hollister, Charlotte Russe are stores who have pretty clothes and aren't that expensive.
